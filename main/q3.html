   <h1 style="text-align:center;">PROBLEM C: Rank some stones</h1>
   <p>A group of boys are unequally distributed with some stones and then assembled at the start line of a track.They are all directed to jump a specific distance in the straight direction and drop a stone, and continue this until they are left with no stones.In such a way each boy will drop all his stones he had initially. Ofcourse these boys will have different physique and hence will have differrent jump lengths and also it may happen that many of these boys have the same number of stones initially.<br><br>You will be provided with the total number of boys and, jump length and initial number of stones provided to each individual.<br><br>Let R be any natural number given as input, you are required to find out the distance of R^(th) stone from the beginning.</p>
   <p><strong>Input Format :</strong><br><br>First line contains the total number of boys N.<br><br>Next N lines have two space-seperated integer S and J corresponding to number of stones initially and length of jump.<br><br>Last line will have one integer R.</p>
   <p><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>For <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>20</mn><mo>%</mo></math>of score <br>
   <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>J , S</mi><mo>&#x2264;</mo><mn>10</mn></math><br><br>
   <p><br /><strong>Output Format:</strong><br><br>Output a single integer which is the distance of m^(th) stone from the beginning.</p>
